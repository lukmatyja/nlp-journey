# Introduction

Welcome to my NLP journey. I'm about to go through NLP and technologies around Natural Language Processing. I'm going to explain terminology, algorithms, and tools helpful in text (and speech) processing. I will try to focus on processing polish language. It's not so common as english or other western languages and it's not even supported by services in AWS, Google (except Dialogflow), Azure, so the level of difficulty is quite high.

Bear in mind, that I'm not a NLP expert (yet). All I'm going to do here will be like gaining experience and continuous learning.

From zero to hero!
